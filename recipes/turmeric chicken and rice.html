    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds of chicken(8 pieces)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 small onion chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of fresh finely chopped ginger</li>
        <li>4 minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 chopped plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of curry powder</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 cups of jasmine rice</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons of fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups of chicken stock</li>
        <li>plain whole yogurt, sliced cucumbers and lime wedges for serving</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p><h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large enameled cast-iron casserole or Dutch oven,
         melt the butter and sprinkle with the turmeric. Add the chicken skin side down and cook over moderately high heat,
         turning once, until browned on both sides, 8 minutes total. Transfer the chicken to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, ginger, and garlic to the casserole and cook, stirring occasionally, until starting to brown,
         about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, and rice and stir constantly until fragrant,
         about 1 minute. Return the chicken to the pot, skin side up. Add the bay leaves, fish sauce,
         and chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. Adjust the lid to cover partially and simmer until the rice is cooked,
         10 to 15 minutes longer. Remove from the heat, uncover, and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve with yogurt, cucumbers, mint, and lime wedges.</li>
